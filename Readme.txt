used the component, locator, command and observer pattern in the engine.
the other patterns im not that sure about... as i struggled with the idea of combining all of them together..

also ended up using a home made factory pattern, as i just was looking for a easy way to test a lot of gameobjects
and doing .addComp() gets redundant :/ . 

i also tried to make the gameobject always the owner of the components, 
thats why in some components you will see "nm_p***" meaning "not my pointer***". 
i found this the easiest with the fact i know who deletes what.


sadly i was not able to show it off in the game. will have to do better for august.

Qbert can move with the arrow keys on a XBoxController.
